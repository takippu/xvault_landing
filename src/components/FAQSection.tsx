      question: "What is xVault?",
      answer: "xVault is a Chrome extension that helps you store and organize frequently used text snippets, such as code blocks, email templates, and more. It features end-to-end encryption to keep your data secure. All features are now completely free."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data secure with xVault?",
      answer: "Yes, xVault uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that your data is only accessible to you. Your snippets are encrypted by choice and only stored in your browser, and we don't have access to your encryption keys."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use xVault on multiple devices?",
      answer: "Yes, you can use xVault on multiple devices, as long as you have the extension installed. However, as we don't store your snippets on cloud, we couldn't sync the snippets, therefore you must export it to the new browser."
    },
    {
      question: "How many snippets can I store?",
      answer: "There is no limit. xVault is now completely free and allows you to store unlimited snippets."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I organize my snippets into folders?",
      answer: "Yes, all features including folder organization are free for everyone."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a mobile app for xVault?",
      answer: "Currently, xVault is only available as a Chrome extension."
